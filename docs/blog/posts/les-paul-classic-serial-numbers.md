Over the years, **Gibson** used different pattern for the serial numbers for the Les Paul Classic.
The serial number is typically found on the back of the headstock.
The serial number is a unique identifier for each guitar, and it can be used to determine the year of production.

## History of the serial number patterns

### Before July 2005
Before July 2005, the serial number pattern for Gibson guitars was as follow:
`YDDDYRRR` where `YY` is the production year,
`DDD` is the day of the year,
`RRR` is the factory ranking for that day beginning with 001.

But before July 2005, only Les Paul Classic 1960's were in production.
This model followed a special serial number pattern, explained [below](#the-les-paul-classic-1960).

The next models of Les Paul Classic,
the [Antiques](./2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md),
the [Customs](./2007-les-paul-classic-custom.md), and others,
followed the regular Gibson serial number pattern.

### July 2005 to 2014
In July 2005, Gibson changed the serial number pattern, adding one digit.
The pattern became `YDDDYPRRR`.
`YY` is the production year,
`DDD` is the day of the year,
`P` is an internal code,
`RRR` is the factory ranking for that day beginning with 001.

## The Les Paul Classic 1960
The Les Paul Classic 1960, first introduced in 1989 to 2014, had an ink stamped serial number.
No `Made in USA` stamp was used on the Les Paul Classic 1960.
The serial number will between 4 and 6 digits long.

1989 was the first year of production for the Les Paul Classic.
First year of production and, as there were fewer than 1000 made,
the individual serial number was only 3-digits in length.

Starting 1990, the production of the Les Paul Classic expanded.
The serial number pattern evolved to allow more instrument to be registered.
From 1990 to 1999, the first digit is last digit of year of manufacture and next four digits were individual instrument number

Starting 2000, the serial number pattern evolved again, to include the new century.
From 2000 to 2013, the first two digits last two numbers of year of manufacture; other four as before.

!!! Example "Examples of serial numbers for the Les Paul Classic 1960"

    * `9 011` is produced in 1989; instrument #11.
    * `9 030` is produced in 1989; instrument #30.

    * `9 0030` is produced in 1999; instrument #30. *Note the 2 leading zero for the production number.*
