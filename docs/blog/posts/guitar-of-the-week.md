# All the Guitars Of The Week (GOTW)

In 2007, **Gibson** did a series of limited editions called the Guitar Of The Week, also known as GOTW.
A new limited run of 400 Guitars was presented every week on Tuesdays.
The runs started on January 22nd with an SG Supreme Bass and finished on December 18th with a reissue of an RD Standard.

These limited editions brought a lot of different models on the market,
with different sets of features that were not common at this time.
In some cases, like the Week 33, the old Gibson logo on the headstock can confuse and make you think the Guitar is
fake.[^3]

It is often mentioned that #45 was pulled and turned into the Joan Jett signature model Melody Maker, but Gibson has not
confirmed this.[^2]

## Details on Les Paul Classic models

### Week 2 - Les Paul Classic Antique

The Week 2 - Les Paul Classic Antique, released on January 29th, 2007, is a Les Paul Classic Antique, including a
figured maple top and a pair of Gibson's '57 Classic humbuckers—with a special Fireburst finish.

### Week 5 - Les Paul Classic Antique Artist Series

It is another Les Paul Classic Antique. This Guitar has a unique finish, made and signed
by Tom Morgan. The finishing is sometimes called Tom Morgan Lava. The back is painted black.

### Week 14 - Les Paul Classic Antique 2 H-90 Pickups

For Week 14, The Les Paul Classic Antique is updated with unique H-90 pickups and an Iced Tea Sunburst finish on a
figured maple top. Gibson's H-90 stacked double coil pickup results from a close collaboration
with Billie Joe Armstrong. It offers the snarl and punch of a classic, vintage P-90, but with none of the
60-cycle hum that usually plagues traditional single coil pickups.[^4]

### week 16 - Les Paul Classic Custom Silverburst

### week 19 - Les Paul Classic Antique Zebra Wood

### Week 27 - Les Paul Classic Antique - Faded Cherry

The Week 27's Les Paul Classic Antique continues Gibson's Classic line with vintage touches.
The mahogany top is finished in Faded Cherry. The pickups are '57 Classic PAF humbuckers.

### Week 28 - Les Paul Classic Custom 2 P-90 Pickups

Week 28 is a Les Paul Classic Custom drawing on the legendary Black Beauty Les Pauls.
It comes with P-90 pickups, antique ebony, a single-bound body, gold hardware, and a slim 60s-style taper neck.
Unlike a Black Beauty, a Gibson Les Paul Custom, the Week 28 doesn't have the binding on the back of the body or the
diamond in the headstock.[^5]

### Week 33 - Les Paul Classic Antique - Mahogany Top

This Les Paul Classic is unique because of its Antique Vintage Sunburst finish and mahogany top.[^3]

### Week 39 - Les Paul Classic Custom Antique White

The Week 39 is a Les Paul Classic Custom.
Its originality comes from a pristine Antique White finish, Custom—gold hardware, an ebony fingerboard, white binding
and inlays, and two covered '57 Classics.

### Week 42 - Les Paul Classic Custom w/3 Pickups

The Week 42 is a Les Paul Classic Custom with a trio of cream Dimarzio Super Distortion pickups. The finish is a
Heritage Cherry Sunburst. The model is near the Les Paul Custom Ace Frehley signature. The differences between the
two models are in the headstock and the back of the body. The headstock of this model has the crown instead of the
artist's face. The back doesn't have the binding. The neck inlay of the signature model has a unique thunderbolt shape.

### Week 46 - Les Paul Classic Custom w/3 Pickups Ebony

Like Week 28, Week 46 is a close copy of a Gibson Les Paul Custom, but as a Les Paul Classic Custom. Like Week 42,
it comes with three pickups but with gold hardware. It can be differentiated from the custom by the headstock with a
crown instead of a diamond and the back of the body without binding and no block inlays.
