In 2007, **Gibson**, along the [Les Paul Classic Custom](./2007-les-paul-classic-custom.md) did a short run of Les Paul
Classic Antique models.
The Les Paul Classic Antique has a crown on the headstock
and an aged binding on the body and neck.
<!-- more -->

The regular edition of Les Paul Classic Antique was produced between 2007 and 2008.
In 2007, the Les Paul Classic Antique was also part of
the [Guitar Of The Week](blog/category/guitar-of-the-week---gotw/) series.

All the Antique come initially with a Hardshell With a Black Reptile Pattern with a white interior.

## A royal headstock

Typically, the headstock of a Gibson USA Les Paul Classic has a silk screen with "Les Paul Model" written on it.
The Gibson Custom Shop has a split diamond inlay.
The Classic Antique wears a crown that replaces the silk screen.
This crown is not a unique feature. It can also be found on the SG or ES models.

## Aged bindings

The antique refers to an aged guitar that comes from the past.
The binding on the body and the neck has a yellow tint to mimic what happens to the binding over time.
The light has tinted the lacquer on vintage guitars over the years.
The lacquer turns yellow.
It is more evident in the biding as it is white or cream. However,  the entire guitar is affected by aging. On the Antique, the aging effect is only applied to the binding.

### Guitar Of The Week 14 - Les Paul Classic Antique - H90

For Week 14, The Les Paul Classic Antique is updated with unique H-90 pickups and an Iced Tea Sunburst finish on a
figured maple top. Gibson's H-90 stacked double coil pickup results from a close collaboration
with Billie Joe Armstrong. It offers the snarl and punch of a classic, vintage P-90 but with none of the
60-cycle hum that usually plagues traditional single-coil pickups.

### Guitar Of The Week 19 - Les Paul Classic Antique - Zebra

The week 19 offers a unique [Zebrawood](https://www.wood-database.com/zebrawood/) top without binding.
This unique wood is known for its striking appearance and gives the guitar a rough and wild look.
Mind that the tops have different waves and lines and can differ significantly from one guitar to another.
It can be hard to evaluate the quality of the wood from a picture.
The finish is a natural satin.

The guitar is packed with two Burstbucker Pro humbuckers in neck and bridge positions.

### Guitar Of The Week #33, Les Paul Classic Antique - Mahogany Top


It is easy to confuse the regular edition of the Antique with The Guitar of The Week #33.
They are both in a vintage sunburst with chrome hardware.
However, the distinct details make week #33 different from its sister.

The headstock of the limited edition has a pre-war Gibson logo.
The crown and the binding are not present on the headstock.
The regular Les Paul Model silk screen replaces the crown.

The finish is also something to pay attention to.
The limited edition has a smooth satin finish instead of a gloss finish. Finally, the vintage sunburst is darker in this
model.
