Over the years of production of Les Paul Classics,
**Gibson** has used different patterns for the serial numbers.
The serial number is a unique identifier for each guitar,
and it can be used to determine the day of production.

Serial number of 1960 Classics is as follows;

## 1989
9 XXX = 1989. First year of production and, as there were fewer than 1000 made, the individual serial number was only 3-digits in length.

Examples -
9 xxx = 1989 (4-digit number beginning with "9" used only in 1989)
0 xxxx = 1990
9 xxxx = 1999
00xxxx = 2000
05xxxx = 2005

## 1990 - 1999
From 1990 - 1999 : First digit is last digit of year of manufacture and next four digits were individual instrument number. 5 9669 = 1995; instrument # 9669.

## 2000 - 2013
From 2000+ : First two digits last two numbers of year of manufacture; other four as before. 02 1234 = 2002; instrument #1234.

## 2014 - mid 2019
**These serial numbers cannot be dated to a specific day of the year.**

The new model year typically launches in the fall as the current model year winds down. It is not uncommon for a new model year model to be produced during the previous model year (example – a 2015 model may have been built in late 2014).

The pattern is as follows:

YYRRRRRRR
YY is the model year
RRRRRRR is the number in product for the model year (starts at 0000001)

## Mid 2019 - present
In 2019, Gibson USA reverted back to it’s previous post-2005 scheme, which follows this pattern:

__YDDDYRRRR

YY is the production year
DDD is the day of the year
RRRR is the factory ranking for that day beginning with 0001__
