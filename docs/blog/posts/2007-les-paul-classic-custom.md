In 2007, **Gibson**, along the [Les Paul Classic Antique](./2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md), released the fist version of the Les Paul Classic Custom.
The guitar was a mix of the Les Paul Custom and the Les Paul Classic, with a mahogany body and neck, a maple top, and a rosewood fingerboard.

The guitar was equipped with a pair of unique 57's gold-appointed â€™57 Classic humbuckers and a slim-taper neck.
This version was only available in a black ebony finish, with a aged binding and gold hardware, making it look like a Black beauty from the 50's.

The first edition, only available in a black ebony finish, was produced between 2007 and 2008.
Additionally, in 2007, the Les Paul Classic Antique was also part of the [Guitar Of The Week](blog/category/guitar-of-the-week---gotw/) series.
Followed, then by several additional runs in 2011 to 2012, then in 2014, with different specs.
