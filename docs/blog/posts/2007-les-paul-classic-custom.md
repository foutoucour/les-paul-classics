# The Classic Customs
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/1200x500/)

In 2007, **Gibson**, along the [Les Paul Classic Antique](./2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md), released the fist version of the Les Paul Classic Custom.
The guitar was a mix of the Les Paul Custom and the Les Paul Classic, with a mahogany body and neck, a maple top, and a rosewood fingerboard.
<!-- more -->

Additionally, in 2007, the Les Paul Classic Antique was also part of the [Guitar Of The Week](blog/category/guitar-of-the-week---gotw/) series.
Followed, then by several additional runs in 2011 to 2012, then in 2014, with different specs.
No classic custom was produced after 2014.

The Classic Custom shares the same distinct features than her sister, the [crown inlay on the headstock](2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md#a-royal-headstock), the [aged binding](2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md#aged-bindings).

All the Classic Custom have a common attribute.
They all are close to a model produced by the Gibson Les Paul Shop.
Many of them mimics the fantastic Black Beauty, with an ebony finish.
That's a reason why they wear a multi binding.
It's a tribute to the original Black Beauty.

five different versions of the Les Paul Classic Custom were produced, each with unique features.

## Details on the different models

---
### Les Paul Classic Custom 2007-2008

The guitar was equipped with a pair of unique gold-appointed ’57 Classic humbuckers and a slim-taper neck.
This version was only available in a black ebony finish, with a aged binding and gold hardware, making it look like a Black beauty from the 50's.

The first edition, only available in a black ebony finish, was produced between 2007 and 2008, with only 150 to 200 copies,
making it one of the rarest Les Paul Classic models ever produced by Gibson.

All these assets make the Les Paul Classic Custom a very desirable guitar for collectors.
