In 2007, **Gibson**, along with the [2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md](2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md)[Les Paul Classic Antique](./2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md), released the first version of the Les Paul Classic Custom.
The guitar was a mix of the Les Paul Custom and the Les Paul Classic, with a mahogany body and neck, a maple top, and a rosewood fingerboard.
<!-- more -->

In 2007, the Les Paul Classic Custom was also part of the [Guitar Of The Week](blog/category/guitar-of-the-week---gotw/) series.
Followed by several additional runs from 2011 to 2012 and then in 2014, with different specs.
No classic custom was produced after 2014.

The Classic Custom shares the same distinct features as her sister: the [crown inlay on the headstock](2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md#a-royal-headstock) and the [aged binding](2007-les-paul-classic-antique.md#aged-bindings).

All the Classic Customs have a common attribute.
They are all close to a model the Gibson Les Paul Custom Shop produced.
Many of them mimic the fantastic Black Beauty with an ebony finish.
That's the reason why they wear multi-binding clothes.
They look to be tributes to the original Les Paul Custom Black Beauty.
The original Classic Custom from 2007 can be seen as a tribute the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230727062646/https://www.gibson.com/en-US/Electric-Guitar/CUSGJ5555/Ebony-2-Pickup" target=_blank>1957's Les Paul Custom</a>.
The guitar also had a brass truss rod cover with the words `Les Paul` engraved on it.

### A tribute to the Les Paul Custom

Although Classic Custom guitars looked similar to the Les Paul Custom, some differences could be spotted by a keen eye.

For instance, the first difference was in the fretboard inlays.
While the Black Beauty had block inlays, Classic Custom had trapezoid inlays.
Moreover, the first case of the neck was not inlaid, unlike the Black Beauty.

The Classic Custom guitar had a slim taper neck, while the Black Beauty had a 50's round C.

The headstock was another point of differentiation.
It had a crown inlay, while the Les Paul Custom had a split diamond inlay.
Exception for the edition 2011-2012, which out on a split-diamond inlay.

The back of the guitar was also different.
The 7-ply binding was only on the top of the body, whereas the back was not bound.
In contrast, the Black Beauty had a 7-ply binding on both the top and the back.

## Inventory of the Les Paul Classic Custom

The first Les Paul Classic Custom was produced in 2007 and 2008.
In 2007, during the [Guitar of the Week](2007-guitar-of-the-week.md) series,
five different versions of the Les Paul Classic Custom were produced, each with unique features.

The Les Paul Classic Custom was also produced in 2011, 2012, and 2014.

## Details on the different models

---
### Les Paul Classic Custom 2007-2008

The guitar has a pair of unique gold-appointed '57 Classic humbuckers and a slim-taper neck.
This version was only available in a black ebony finish, with an aged binding and gold hardware, making it look like a Black beauty from the 50s.

The first edition, only available in a black ebony finish, was produced between 2007 and 2008, with only 150 to 200 copies,
making it one of the rarest Les Paul Classic models ever produced by Gibson.

All these assets make the Les Paul Classic Custom a desirable guitar for collectors.

### Week 28 - Les Paul Classic Custom 2 P-90 Pickups

For week 28, Gibson released a special edition Les Paul Classic Custom with two P-90 pickups.
The guitar was available only in a black ebony finish, with an aged binding and gold hardware, which gave it a look similar to a [Les Paul Custom from 1954](https://www.gibson.com/en-US/Electric-Guitar/CUSZ44594/Ebony).

The main difference between week 28 and the original Classic Custom was the pickups.
Week 28 featured P-90s instead of humbuckers.

#### A tribute to the 1954's Black Beauty
The two P-90 pickups on the guitar makes it a tribute to the [1954 Black Beauty](https://www.gibson.com/en-US/Electric-Guitar/CUSZ44594/Ebony).
Note, the original Black Beauty had an alnico V "staple" pickup in the neck position and a P-90 in the bridge position.
