# All The Guitars Of The Week (GOTW)

![Les Paul Classic](./img/2007-les-paul-classic-week-05-body.jpg){ loading=lazy }
In 2007, **Gibson** did a series of limited editions called the Guitar Of The Week, also known as GOTW.
A new limited run of 400 Guitars was presented every week on Tuesdays.
The runs started on January 22nd with an SG Supreme Bass and finished on December 18th with a reissue of an RD Standard.

These limited editions brought a lot of different models on the market,
with varying sets of features that were not common at this time.
In some cases, like the Week 33, the old Gibson logo on the headstock can confuse and make you think the Guitar is
fake. _Reference: [The "FANCY" Logo, 2007 Gibson Guitar of the Week 33 GOTW 33 Les Paul Classic Antique Review + Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-38AOmakes)_

!!! note "Week 45 was skipped"
    It is often mentioned that #45 was pulled and turned into the Joan Jett signature model Melody Maker, but Gibson has not
    confirmed this.
