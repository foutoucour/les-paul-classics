Since the first year of production, in 1989, the Les Paul Classic has been a popular model.
The Classic has been produced in different versions, and each one has its own unique features.

Different models have been produced, and we are documenting them all.

The listing include the model, a picture of one of the finishes, the year the production started, and the year it ended.
The links are to the dedicated pages for each model and the Reverb page for the model.
