Since the first year of production, in 1989, the Les Paul Classic has been a popular model.
The Les Paul Classic has been produced in different versions, and each one has its own unique features.
And we are documenting them all.

Each Les Paul Classic can be seen a tribute to a iconic Les Paul guitar.
The first Les Paul Classic, the 1960, was a tribute to the 1960 Les Paul Standard.


In 2018, a version with two P90 pickups was released.
It was produced with a gold top finish and an ebony finish, tribute to the Les Paul of 1956.
