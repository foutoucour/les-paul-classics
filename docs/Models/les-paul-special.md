# :heart_eyes: Les Paul Special

The Gibson Les Paul Special is a distinct variant of the Les Paul line, originally introduced in the 1950s. Characterized by its flat-top, single-cutaway mahogany body, it offers a simpler aesthetic compared to the standard Les Paul. This model typically features P90 pickups, delivering a raw, punchy tone that's different from the humbucker-equipped Les Pauls. It's known for its straightforward design with a focus on playability and tonal clarity. The Les Paul Special has been a favorite among players seeking a no-frills, yet classic Gibson sound and feel.
