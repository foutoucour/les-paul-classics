    Part of Gibson's attempt to redesign old classics,
    the Gibson Les Paul Classic Custom is a recent twist on the old Les Paul Custom design.
    Taking elements from the original Custom,
    the Classic Custom features block inlays,
    multi-layer binding, and the iconic Les Paul Custom headstock.
    However, the new Les Paul Classic Custom uses a processed maple for the fingerboard,
    partly due to wood sourcing issues faced by the company.
