However, what appears as P-90s are H-90 pickups: 'Humbuckers'-90. These are not traditional P-90s but a particular type of pickup developed by Gibson in collaboration with Billie Joe Armstrong. The H-90 offers the snarl and punch of a classic, vintage P-90 with no 60-cycle hum that usually plagues traditional single-coil pickups. H-90 pickups are stacked magnets on top of each other, while regular humbuckers are side-by-side magnets.</p> <p>Additionally, the H-90 offers a split to mimic the sound of regular P-90s.
